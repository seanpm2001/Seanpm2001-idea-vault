# Unblur tool

Idea conceived: 2 days ago (April 20th 2021)

## Overview

The unblur tool is an extremely privacy invasive project but the concept and capability was inevitable. Please only use this tool for good. Other usage can result in legal action against you. 

## Public awareness

I need to force public awareness of this vulnerability, but it is already too late for hundreds of thousands of images and videos. The solution is that if you are to blur an image, you need to make it impossible to reverse. It is already pretty late to be doing this, but it has to be done, so that future info can be better protected. A good way to censor is to put opaque shapes over sensitive data, or pixelate it with very large DPI pixels.
