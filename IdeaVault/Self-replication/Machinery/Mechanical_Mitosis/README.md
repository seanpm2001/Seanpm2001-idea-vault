# Mechanical Mitosis

Overview of my idea for Mechanical Mitosis

## Overview

Mechanical Mitosis is a model of machine self-replication where a computer can go through mitosis (similar to cell replication in humans and other animals and plants, just known as mitosis)

## Origin

I thought of this idea in the past month, but I don't have the exact date. I am coining this for now on April 20th 2021.

Original idea date: `currently unknown, although it originated sometime between March 10th 2021 and April 18th 2021`
